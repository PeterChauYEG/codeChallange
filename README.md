This is my solution to the Code for Canada Fellowship Web Developer code challenge.

This take a dataset representing the building code violations. It summerized the data and can calculate:
- the number of violations in each category
- the earlist and latest violation date for each category.

## Setup
- run `npm start` in a command prompt
- a readout should be rendered to the command prompt
